The Country Ban module allows the admin to set various countries around the
world to either 'read only' or to ban them entirely.

Account access will be completely disabled for those IP addresses originating
from countries which are set to read only; however, the site content may still
be viewed. 

Setting a country to a "complete" ban will disable the entire website for those
IP addresses originating from the designated country. 


Installation
------------
Country Ban is dependent upon IP-based Determination of a Visitor's Country,
which is available here: http://drupal.org/project/ip2country

This module provides the country of origin that Country Ban requires to filter
properly.

Other standard module installation applies.
